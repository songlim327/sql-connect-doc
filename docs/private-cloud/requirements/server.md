# Server

Please fulfill the server requirements below.

## Network

2. Reserve 2 IP Address:
    - First IP Address: Windows server
    - Second IP Address: Debian 9 virtual machine
3. Must have wired network connection/**Ethernet**.
4. Port forwarding pointing towards the Debian virtual machine. Configuration details as below:

    ```txt
    8822[WAN] : 4822[LAN] - TCP    
    8122[WAN] : 22[LAN] - TCP
    ```

    :::caution Notes
    NO PORT FORWARDING ON THE WINDOWS.
    :::

5. Have a ready **dynamic DNS (DDNS)** / Fixed WAN IP Address.

## Hardware

1. CPU model not older than Intel i5 (5th generation) or AMD Ryzen 5.
2. RAM should have at least 8GB.
3. Make sure CPU Virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.
4. We encourage users to switch on the PC for 24/7 so that maintenance work can be carried out without interferring users' work during work time.
5. Must have Solid State Drive (**SSD**).

## Operating System

1. Windows Defender did it's job pretty well in protecting/securing your server. No **third party antivirus** should be installed in the server.
:::note Explanation
Third party antivirus including avast, avira, kaspersky and so on have different behavior. Each of them acts differently towards SQL Connect setup. Besides, if these antivirus update and breaks SQL Connect dependencies, it will take a long time for us to debug and resolve before your service back online. The windows antivirus (Windows Defender) has became very mature and is sufficient in securing your server.

2. If you have used/installed serverlink in the server before, kindly **reformat** your server.
3. During the setup, automatic **Windows Update** will be disabled. However, users still able to update by clicking on the update in the settings.
4. SQL Connect only support **Windows 10 Professional** (version 1709, 1803, 1809), **Windows 11 Professional** and **Windows Server 2016** (Essential Edition and above).
    - The version mentioned above supports unlimited concurrent users.
    - Others will have a limit of 15 concurrent users login at once.
5. Make sure to enable hyper-v in the server.

    - Step 2: [Enable BIOS Virtualization](https://us.informatiweb.net/tutorials/it/bios/enable-virtualization-intel-vt-x-amd-v--3.html)
    - Step 3: [Enable Hyper-V Virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)

## Login Credentials

1. SQL Connect implemented **Google OpenID Connect (OIDC)** standard and utilize it in user login. This enhances the security and eliminates the use of username and password.
2. Before setup SQL Connect server, users may prepare Google emails (Gmails). We will create the entries in our system and users will be able to login directly to our website with the Gmails without all the hassle.
3. Other OpenID standard such as Microsoft, Facebook, etc. will be release in the future.
